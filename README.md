Run in the command line:
`python puzzleSolver.py <A> <N> <H> <INPUT FILE PATH> <OUTPUT FILE PATH>`

Where A is the algorithm (A=1 for A* and A=2 for RBFS), N is the size of puzzle (N=3 for 8-puzzle and N=4 for 15-puzzle), H is for heuristics (H=1 for h1 and H=2 for h2), INPUT FILE PATH and OUTPUT FILE PATH are the input and output filenames.

h1 = Manhattan Distance

h2 = Hamming Distance
